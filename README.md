# PostIt!

This app was built during course 301 at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). This is a basic Reddit-like application with the ability to post links, create comments, and vote on both of them.

This project was built with Ruby on Rails and contains several features:
* Create and edit posts
* Comment and vote on posts
* User login/authentication
* Two-factor authentication using Twilio (currently disabled, but trust me it works).
* Database tracks who created every post, comment, vote.
* View and edit user profiles
* Roles to allow admins to edit all posts
* Ajax used for voting
* Slugs used for URLs
* User-specific timezones

This project was my first exposure to Ruby on Rails. I have learned:
* Relational databases
* 1:M and M:M associations
* ActiveRecord
* RESTful resources
* routing
* MVC
* Partials, Helpers, Filters, Forms, Validations, Strong Parameters
* Authentication from scratch
* Timezones, simple roles, deployment, ajax using Rails, building APIs
* Publishing ruby gems
* Working with Twilio
